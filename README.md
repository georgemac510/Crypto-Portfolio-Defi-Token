# Crypto-Portfolio-Defi-Token


Using Scaffold-ETH, we were able to create and deploy an exchange traded token (ETT) which will represent either an index portfolio of the top 10 cryptocurrency tokens based on capitalization (listing on Coin Market Cap) or a portfolio of tokens in the same utilization group or industry (i.e. DeFi or privacy tokens). At this point, we are the Scaffold-ETH dapp as our UI since time for this project was limited. Our token is deployed to the Kovan Ethereum testnet and can be found at http://exchange-token.surge.sh/.

We have also listed locally our token Exchange Traded Token (EXTT) on the Aave Lender platform through Scaffold-ETH.
